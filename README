General structure of the code:

sys_dict contains all the global system parameters and information different functions need to perform their task. 

state is another global variable, holding the position and velocoty information of the 
system.

Other than some standard numpy package, I wrote a small package called "tools" myself to
divide the functions into multiple files and only leave the main program in file MD.py.
