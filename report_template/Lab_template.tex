\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Random Number Generator}

The random number generator implemented here is a simple Linear Congruential
Generator(LCG), which is generally a recursive mapping within a certain integer
domain. for a set of parameters (a,c,m):

\begin{align*}
  x_{N+1} &= (x_N * a + c) \mod m \\
  \xi \colon \{1,2,3,\dots,m-1\} &\to \{1,2,3,\dots,m-1\}
\end{align*}

Some special sets of (a,c,m) give seemingly very random and uniform distribution
of results in recursive mapping. Based on this feature, we consider this recursive 
method as a random number generator. 

In this experiment (a=1559, c=313, m=13229) are chosen. 
The main characteristic of these parameters is that they are all primes, in order
to try to avoid periodicity behaviors in the random sequance.
This special set is chosen by testing different combinations of (a,c,m) in a
small parameter space.

\subsection{Random Walk}
  
A random walk, in simple terms, is a random sequance representing the 
accumulative sum of a random variable. In a simple 3D case:

\begin{align*}
  \vec{X_N} &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} \vec{s_i} \\
  \mbox{where} \quad  \vec{s} \in V &= \{(1,0,0), (-1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,-1,0), (0,0,1),(0,0,-1)\} \\
  \mbox{Assigning} \quad P(\vec{v}) &\equiv 1/6 \quad \mbox{for}  \quad \vec{v} \in V
\end{align*}

Probability analysis give this famous relationship:

\begin{align*}
  <|\vec{X_N}|^2> = \sqrt{N} 
\end{align*}

This relationship can be verified by a Monte Carlo Method, averaging the results
over a large number of samples. Alternatively, we can use it to evaluate the 
randomness of our LCG generator.
\section{Code}

\subsection{Linear Congruential Generator}

\lstinputlisting[language=Python,firstline=8, lastline=23]{lab1.py}

LCG is the linear congruential generator with parameters a=1559, c=313 (647),
m=13229. The seed of the generator is determined by decimal time. The structure of it
is a python generator, which is a sequance of predefined operations. This gives a good 
structure to continuously generate any length of random numbers and also avoids defining
a global state variable. The outputs of this function (after "yield") is normalized to 
(0,1) by dividing it by m. 

\subsection{3D Random Walk}

\lstinputlisting[language=Python,firstline=29, lastline=37]{lab1.py}

\lstinputlisting[language=Python,firstline=52, lastline=66]{lab1.py}

As can be seen, I created two versions of random walk function, one with uniform random
floating step size and the other with fixed integer step size. They are for different 
types of purposes, and requires different set of parameters of LCG to get reasonable 
results. Since function RandomWalk\_fs is by nature a mere assembling of three 
mutually independent 1D random walks, I tend to use the second one in which each step
the walker randomly choose a direction among x, y, z and randomly chooses to go 1 step
forward or backward. In such case, the three axes are no longer independent.

In the second function, I made use of another function random\_choice, which is a 
mimic of np.random.choice function, but with my LCG as the random number generator.

\section{Application}

\subsection{P\'olya's Random Walk Problem}

In this part we make use of the function RandomWalk to solve a problem named after  
P\'olya. The problem is:

\begin{center}
	\textit{
	For a random walk on a n-dimensional lattice, what is the probability of it
	returning to the origin?
	}
\end{center}

Since this is a lattice random walk, each step shall be a fixed integer step along one
of the three normal directions, we shall use function RandomWalk. The script I used for
this problem is called returning.py

The idea is simple, we conduct a large number of random walks (10000 particles) of 
sufficient steps (20000 steps), and record how many of them comes back. We conduct 
this experiment several times (10 times), and if the resultant probability have a small 
enough standard deviation, we believe that this result is close to the theoretical 
prediction. I conducted this experiment for dimension 1 - 5, the results are as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c c }
	dim & p\_exp(d) & std & p(d) \\
	1 & 0.9941& 0.0007& 1 \\
	2 & 0.753& 0.003& 1 \\
	3 & 0.337& 0.005& 0.340537 \\
	4 & 0.193& 0.005& 0.193206 \\
	5 & 0.134& 0.002& 0.135178
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

As can be seen, other than the result of dimension 2, the other experimental values match
the theoretical ones. This is expected, since we can not take an infinite amount of steps
for run time consideration, the resultant value will be smaller than the theoretical prediction. In our case, 20000 steps is enough for one dimensional case but not for two dimensional case. 
While in 3, 4, 5 dimensional cases the results match because the probability converge faster as we increase the dimension. 

\section{Results and Analysis}

Using the mean squared distance relationship, we can test the randomness of our LCG 
generator. By nature, random walks are sequances that have relatively large fluctuations,
so in oreder to conduct a reasonable test, a large number of samples need to be taken to
get an average result with relatively small deviations.

Below is a MSD vs N plot of 5000 steps, averaged over 500 particles. Comparing our LCG
generator with numpy generator:

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{linear.pdf}

The slope of the LCG graph is 1.022 while that of numpy generator is 1.009. At least for
random walk with steps equal or below 5000, our generator gives a reasonably good result Although further investigation showed that beyong 6000 steps, the linearity began to 
break. This could still be expected since 6000 is almost half of m, which limits the 
period of our generator.

\section{Conclusion}

To concude, we have implemented a linear congruential random number generator and chosen
an effective set of parameters so that it remains random for a quite long period of time.
We then made use of the LCG generator to generate random walk sequances. Averaging over
many particles, we made a linear plot between MSD and steps of the random walk, which 
proved that our generator remains quite random below 6000 steps. In addition to this, 
we also made use of the Random Walk function to help us solve a probability problem.
