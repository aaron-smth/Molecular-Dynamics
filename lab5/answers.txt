Can lambda reflect the chaotic behavior seen in bifurcation diagram?

Comparing the Bifurcation plot and the Lyapunov plot, we could see that all
positive lambda values are in the chaotic regions on the right. The few dips
on the right represents the non-chaotic windows area.

How does lambda depend on a particular value of x?

As coould be seen from ly_exp2.png, where the four cases where 
x0=0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9
were plotted against each other. As the graph shows, specific x0 does not change 
the overall shape of the lambda to alpha graph, but varies in some details.

Find a case where the Lyapunov exponent is zero

As coud be seen from graph ly_exp.png and bif.png, all the bifurcation 
points (where one branch divide into two) correspond to a peak where the Lyapunov 
exponent is nearly 0.
