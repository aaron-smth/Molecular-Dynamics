This is a repository for a physics lab on molecular dynamics

The script MD.py is the main MD part.
In it the class MD_sys is the molecular dynamics system,
it can be run either from a new initial condition it generats or from an existing MD_sys object or from an existin MD_sys object.
After each run, it stores all the information in an file called sys.obj

The script st.py is the statistical analysis part.
It loads the object sys.obj, make statistical quantities and generates plots.

This design allows one to divide a very time consuming job into multiple small
runs so as to get feedbacks in time. Also, it is very helpful to divide the main
calculation from the statistics, as often we'd like to modify the 
statistical part (perhapes to add more features) and wouldn't want to run the whole 
program again.

The script tools.py contain some other small functions I used to help converting files,
recording information and so on.
The plots are saved in the energy.pdf file
